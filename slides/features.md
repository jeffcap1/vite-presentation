<ul>
	<li v-click='2'>For context, three.js is 585kb minified and 150kb gzip</li>
	<li v-click='4'>10 to 100x faster than current JS based bundlers</li>
</ul>

<!--
This is a replacement for Webpack
Esbuild is written in Go and compiled to native code making it incredible fast when compared to any javascript based compiler.

# Unbundled Local Development

<v-clicks>

- Pre-bundles modules and converts commonJS to ESM
- Rewrites imports to use the pre-bundled version making it browser importable
- Strongly caches dependencies
- Only needs to compile your code changes

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Why pre-bundle:
	+ lodash-es has over 600 internal modules!
	+ When we do import { debounce } from 'lodash-es', the browser fires off 600+ HTTP requests at the same time!
- Explain briefly and then show Vite pictures

# Bundled in Production

<v-clicks>

- Vite bundles to production using a preconfigured version of Rollup
- Uses Rollup instead of esbuild since it's more mature and feature rich
- Http/2 and esm are still ineffecient with multiple round trips to server
- Ensures website still works with new and old browsers
- Enables tree shaking, lazy loading, and common chunks

</v-clicks>

<!--
- esbuild is great for bundling library code
- missing some important features for apps like coe spliting and css
- remember back to the lodash-es example with over 600 internal modules, we wouldn't want that in production.
