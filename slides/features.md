# [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)

<ul v-click='3'>
	<li>10 to 100x faster than current JS based bundlers</li>
</ul>

<!--
This is a replacement for Webpack
Esbuild is written in Go and compiled to native code making it incredible fast when compared to any javascript based compiler.

# Unbundled Local Development

<v-clicks>

- Pre-bundles modules and converts commonJS to ESM
- Rewrites imports to use the pre-bundled version making it browser importable
- Strongly caches dependencies
- Only needs to compile your code changes

</v-clicks>

<!--
Why pre-bundle: lodash-es has over 600 internal modules! When we do import { debounce } from 'lodash-es', the browser fires off 600+ HTTP requests at the same time!
Explain briefly and then show Vite pictures
