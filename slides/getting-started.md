# Getting Started at Goodway

- We've created a getting started guide in the [Coding Standards](https://github.com/GoodwayGroup/coding-standards/blob/master/vite.md) to help teams get up and running quickly
- Brian updated the Goodway Generator with some sub-generators to have Goodway Standard frontend checks and conveniences easily added.

```sh {1|2|3|4|all}
yo goodway:husky
yo goodway:configmap
yo goodway:changelog
yo goodway:conventionalCommits
```
