- It's been consistently fast to use and has taken very little configuration to get setup
- We've created a getting started guide in the [Coding Standards](https://github.com/GoodwayGroup/coding-standards/blob/master/vite.md) to help teams get up and running quickly
- Brian updated the Goodway Generator with some sub-generators to have Goodway Standard frontend checks and conveniences easily added.
