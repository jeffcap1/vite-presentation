# Things to Consider

<v-clicks>

- JSX files require a .jsx file extension
- Only supports ESM imports
  + Your files must use esm module export/import
  + If a package uses commonJS Vite will try to convert it
- Less documentation and examples than Webpack since it is newer
- More to stay on top of since they are moving and making changes fast.
