Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

Vite is _opinionated_ and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also _highly extensible_ via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.
