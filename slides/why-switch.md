# Dev EX

<v-clicks>

- Incredibly fast dev server startup time 
- Fast production builds that stay consistent even as the project grows
- Vite is opinionated reducing the configuration needed to get started
- Has a single vite.config.js file with specific sections for vite\:
  - local development
  - rollups production build
  - testing configurations

<!--
Dev server startup is typically around 300-500 ms 
Production builds have been around 40-45 seconds for RMN
Vite is opinionated, almost no decisions required to get up and running
